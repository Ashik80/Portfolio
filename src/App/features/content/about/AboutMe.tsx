                Hi! I am a web developer. I started my journey of being a developer in September, 2019, and
                have acquired some satisfactory skills in two large frameworks, ASP .NET Core and React JS
                (this site is built on React JS). I plan on learning these frameworks even more deeply. I 
                love learning new things and believe it makes us grow. I have an interest in psychology and
                spirituality and have done significant amount of research on these subjects. I am ready to
                learn and keep learning and take on challenges. My goal is big and I hope to accomplish it. 
                Dream big! 
            </p>
